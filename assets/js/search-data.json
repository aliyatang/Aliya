We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . need to examine code line by line to determine what a procedure does | proceude may or may not produce value | proceudre needs to be defined and called | proceudral abstracation: only know what is not done, not how | . What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values, can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: change the actions if there is an error in the code . Procedural Abstraction: type of abstraction which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: modularity 12222222 5 . Why are procedures effective?: ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program, convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity) . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . x = 7 nums = [] def convertToBinary(x): if x &gt;= 1 and x &lt;= 255: while x/2 != 0: rem = x % 2 nums.append(rem) x = int(x/2) nums.reverse() binary = &quot; &quot; for i in nums: binary = binary + str(i) return binary else: print(&quot;Number not within range.&quot;) print(str(x) + &quot; to binary: &quot; + convertToBinary(x)) ## Function called here . 7 to binary: 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . function findMax(numA, numB) { if (numA &gt; numB) { max = numA min = numB } else if (numA &lt; numB) { max = numB min = numA } else { console.log(&quot;Numbers are equal.&quot;) } console.log(&quot;The max is &quot; + max) console.log(&quot;The min is &quot; + min) } findMax(4, 5) . The max is 5 The min is 4 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def decToBin(x): nums = [] while x/2 != 0: rem = x % 2 nums.append(rem) x = int(x/2) nums.append(0) nums.reverse() binary = &quot; &quot; for i in nums: binary = binary + str(i) print(binary) return binary def charToBin(x): num_list = [] for i in x: num_list.append(decToBin(ord(i))) print(x + &quot;to binary:&quot; + str(num_list)) charToBin(&quot;APCSP&quot;) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get . 01000001 01010000 01000011 01010011 01010000 APCSPto binary:[&#39; 01000001&#39;, &#39; 01010000&#39;, &#39; 01000011&#39;, &#39; 01010011&#39;, &#39; 01010000&#39;] .",

Machine learning at Qualcomm . Learn how to use exposed Python libraries | Run epxeriences | Tensorflow | . Data Analysis . Predict patterns in the data | Use data bases and data science | . Most important skill to have in the tech industry (Takeaways) . Do what you like, don’t be afraid to change | Continuous learning, be open to new ways of learning | Don’t be too concerned about the things you read on the news, much is misleading, just focus on yourself and learn the skills you want | Take risks, the only risk is to not try to learn | Adaptive, your journey, especially your career path will have many highs and lows | Listen to the requirements and translate it to how technology will solve/meet those requirements | . How to overcome challenges in the tech indsutry . Going through changes at Qualcomm, be adaptive | Being able to pass tests, tests where you have to make code in a certain time and have it work | . Takeaways . This panel discussed a lot of ideas that I had previously not thought about. Much of it revovled around change. A takeaway I had is how important it is to be able to overcome and utilize change. This society is really competitive and always changing as it is developing very quickly. There will be many ups and downs in your career path, so you need to be adaptive and be able to take risks so you can overcome this change. Something specific I noticed that is important regarding change is continuous learning, where you constantly learn new skills and knowledge on an ongoing basis. . Another takeaway I had is how you should focus on your own learning, goals, and skill set. It’s important to focus on yourself and what is best for you. I really admire how Kathleen Beveridge quit her job and took a break when she was feeling burnt out, because this way you can focus on yourself and refocus your goals and leanring targets. Also, you shouldn’t let the media distract or scare you too much, especially since most of the information is exaggerated or misleading. . Overall, I found this panel really interesting and it had a lot of good ideas. .",

            "content": "Hack #1 - Class Notes . Simulations | Abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real word, able to draw inferences without constraints of the real world | Use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomnom | Remove specific details an simplify aspects, contain bias based on what is included or excluded | Formulation of hypothese un der consideration | Variability and randomess with random number generators | Ex: rolling dice, spinner, molecular models, analyze chmicals/reactions | . Random: import random . random.choice() - returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence | random.choice(mylist) - returns random value from list | random.randint(0,10) - randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 | random.random() - will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. | . Question: Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 . foodPerDay ← 20 . foodLeft ← 160 . daysStarving ← 0 . REPEAT 5 TIMES { . foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay . foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed . IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { . daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 . } . Why is this simulation considered an abstraction? . 1: It uses a conditional to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met. 2: It uses a REPEAT loop to run the same block of code multiple times. 3: It simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. 4: It does not request input from the user or display output to the user. . Answer: #3 - An abstraction redefinesor simplifies something, which is what 3 talks about . Hack #2 - Functions Classwork . import random x = random.randint(1,100) print(x) . 54 . import random def mycloset(): myclothes = [&quot;red shoes&quot;, &quot;green pants&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;belt&quot;] x = random.choice(myclothes) ans = input(&quot;Would you like to keep your &quot; + x + &quot;? : (y/n)&quot;) if ans == &quot;n&quot;: myclothes.remove(x) print(myclothes) else: print(myclothes) mycloset() . [&#39;red shoes&#39;, &#39;green pants&#39;, &#39;tie&#39;, &#39;belt&#39;] . import random def coinflip(): #def function randomflip = random.randint(0, 2) #picks either 0 or 1 randomly (50/50 chance of either) if randomflip == 0 or randomflip == 2: #assigning 0 to be heads--&gt; if 0 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Heads&quot; print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: if randomflip == 1: #assigning 1 to be tails--&gt; if 1 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Tossing the coin 5 times: t1 = coinflip() t2 = coinflip() t3 = coinflip() t4 = coinflip() t5 = coinflip() . Tails Heads Tails Heads Heads . Explanation: Here, I changed the range of the random.randint() function. I also changed it so that if this outcome is 0 or 2 it is heads. Since there are 3 possible outcomes of this function, 0 or 1 or 2, and 2/3 of those options are heads, the coin flip is now unequal. 2/3 chance for heads, and 1/3 chance for tails. . Hack #3 - Binary Simulation Problem . import random def randomnum(): # function for generating random int x = random.randint(0,255) print(x) return x x = randomnum() nums = [] def converttobin(x): # function for converting decimal to binary while x/2 != 0: rem = x % 2 nums.append(rem) x = int(x/2) while len(nums) &lt; 8: nums.append(0) nums.reverse() print(nums) return nums def survivors(bin): # function to assign position survivorstatus = [&quot;Aliya&quot;, &quot;Tanisha&quot;, &quot;Sharon&quot;, &quot;Claire&quot; , &quot;Allie&quot;, &quot;Olivia&quot;, &quot;Kayla&quot;, &quot;Makayla&quot;] survivordict = {} i = 0 for name in survivorstatus: if bin[i] == 1: survivordict[name] = &quot;Zombie&quot; else: survivordict[name] = &quot;Human&quot; i += 1 for key, val in survivordict.items(): print(key + &quot; is a &quot; + val) # Main program bin = converttobin(x) survivors(bin) . 143 [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] Aliya is a Zombie Tanisha is a Human Sharon is a Human Claire is a Human Allie is a Zombie Olivia is a Zombie Kayla is a Zombie Makayla is a Zombie .

Hack 5 - Applying your knowledge to situation based problems . Using the questions bank below, create a quiz that presents the user a random question and calculates the user&#39;s score. You can use the template below or make your own. Making your own using a loop can give you extra points. . A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however. answer options: The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias | The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details. | If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation. | The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output. | | . | Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool.

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it NumPy, random, pandas | Choose a method from the package and import only the method ex: randint is a method of random package | import the package as a more convenient name. import as | import random as rd print(rd.randint(1,10)) from random import randint as ri print(ri(1,10)) import math as m nums = [1, 2, 3, 4] print(m.fsum(nums)) . 7 7 10.0 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | roundes to the smallest integer greater than or equal to x | . floor() | rounds to largest integer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial of x | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . import math as m x = float(input(&quot;Enter a number:&quot;)) y = float(input(&quot;Enter another number:&quot;)) # Rounded up ceil_x = m.ceil(x) print(ceil_x) ceil_y = m.ceil(y) print(ceil_y) # Rounded down floor_x = m.floor(x) print(floor_x) floor_y = m.floor(y) print(floor_y) # LCM of the rounded down print(m.lcm(floor_x,floor_y)) # GCF of the rounded up print(m.gcd(ceil_y,ceil_y)) # Square root print(m.sqrt(ceil_x)) . 6 8 5 7 35 8 2.449489742783178 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . Extra: I also added a random sidelength generator . . Unit 3.15 Random Values . Purpose/Objectives: Teach student how to implement randomness into their code to make their code simulate real life situations. In this lesson students will learn: . How to import random to python | How to use random with a list or number range | How to code randomness in everyday scenarios | . ADD YOUR ADDITIONAL NOTES HERE: . Random values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all numbers occuring | Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result | Random outputs in the word: Coin flip, marbles, dice | We need random values for code: games, statistical sampling, cryptography, etc | . Random values can be used in coding: . import random random_number = random.randint(1,100) print(random_number) . 19 . def randomlist(): list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;blueberry&quot;] element = random.choice(list) print(element) randomlist() . blueberry . Real life example: Dice Roll . import random for i in range(3): roll = random.randint(1,6) print(&quot;Roll &quot; + str(i + 1) + &quot;:&quot; + str(roll)) . Roll 1:2 Roll 2:5 Roll 3:1 . Challenge #1 . Write a function that will a simulate a coinflip and print the output . import random def coinflip(): options = [&quot;Heads&quot;, &quot;Tails&quot;] print(random.choice(options)) coinflip() . Tails . Homework . Given a random decimal number convert it into binary as Extra convert it to hexidecimal as well. . Extra: I did a decimal to octal converter too . import random x = random.randint(1, 255) ## Decimal to Binary numsBin = [] def convertBin(x): x = int(x) while x/2 != 0: rem = x % 2 numsBin.append(rem) x = int(x/2) numsBin.reverse() binary = &quot;&quot; for i in numsBin: binary = binary + str(i) return binary print(str(x) + &quot; to binary: &quot; + convertBin(x)) ## Decimal to Hex numsHex = [] dict = {0:&#39;0&#39;, 1:&#39;1&#39;, 2:&#39;2&#39;, 3:&#39;3&#39;, 4:&#39;4&#39;, 5:&#39;5&#39;, 6:&#39;6&#39;, 7:&#39;7&#39;, 8:&#39;8&#39;, 9:&#39;9&#39;, 10:&#39;A&#39;, 11:&#39;B&#39;, 12:&#39;C&#39;, 13:&#39;D&#39;, 14:&#39;E&#39;, 15:&#39;F&#39;} def convertHex(x): x = int(x) while x/16 != 0: rem = x % 16 numsHex.append(dict[rem]) x = int(x/16) numsHex.reverse() hex = &quot;&quot; for i in numsHex: hex = hex + str(i) return hex print(str(x) + &quot; to hexidecimal: &quot; + str(convertHex(x))) ## Decimal to Octal numsOct = [] def convertOct(x): x = int(x) if x &lt; 8: octal = x return octal else: while x/8 != 0: rem = x % 8 numsOct.append(rem) x = int(x/8) numsOct.reverse() octal = &quot; &quot; for i in numsOct: octal = octal + str(i) return octal print(str(x) + &quot; to octal: &quot; + str(convertOct(x))) . 203 to binary: 11001011 203 to hexidecimal: CB 203 to octal: 313 .",

To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. .

Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . Done with step in range function . sum = 0 counter = 2 for i in range (1, 10, counter): sum = sum + i print(sum) . 25 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . x = int(input(&quot;Enter any positive integer:&quot;)) print(x) def collatz(x): while x != 1: if x % 2 == 0: x = int(x/2) else: x = x * 3 + 1 print(x) collatz(x) . 6 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . def findSqrt(num): if num &gt;= 1: lower_bound=0 upper_bound=num else: lower_bound=num upper_bound=1 temp=0; err = 0.000001 while(abs(num - (temp * temp)) &gt; err): temp = (lower_bound+upper_bound)/2 temp0 = round(temp) if temp0*temp0 == num: return temp0 if temp*temp &gt;= num: upper_bound = temp elif temp*temp &lt; num: lower_bound = temp return int(temp) # Rounding down to nearest int print(&quot;Sqrt: &quot; + str(findSqrt(49))) print(&quot;Sqrt: &quot; + str(findSqrt(8))) # Extra for exact value, not rounded def exactSqrt(num): if num &gt;= 1: lower_bound=0 upper_bound=num else: lower_bound=num upper_bound=1 temp=0; err = 0.000001 while(abs(num - (temp * temp)) &gt; err): temp = (lower_bound+upper_bound)/2 temp0 = round(temp) if temp0*temp0 == num: return temp0 if temp*temp &gt;= num: upper_bound = temp elif temp*temp &lt; num: lower_bound = temp return temp print(&quot;Sqrt: &quot; + str(exactSqrt(8))) .

            "content": "Results: . . Q13 Test cases for allPositive in a list . Answer A doesn’t encounter a positive number, therefore it reutnrs the intended answer. The correct answer is C, because the procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. . Q30 Benefit of using a list when rounding . For Answer A, the algorithm used to round a numeric value to the nearest integer will be the same regardless of whether the value is stored in a list. The correct answer is B, because using a list as a data abstraction can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain. It is easier to apply the same algorithm to every element in a list than to apply the same algorithm to many separate variables. . Q36 Store even numbers in evenList . Answer B is incorrect, because it generates the list [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21] since i is initialized at 1. Answer C is correct, becaue for the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20] .",

It’s helpful to look through results and see the explanation of correct answers. . 1.3 Daily Video 1 . Essential Knowledge: . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There are multiple development processes. Theses phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigating and reflecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program. | Some ways to preform investigation: collect data through surveys | user tsting | interviews | direct observation | . | Program requirement s describe how a program fucntions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide | A program’s specificaiton defines the requirements for the program | In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplisha given program specification | The desing phase a a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into moduels and fucntional components | creation of diagrams that represent the laouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . 1.3 Daily Video 2 .

Hello, Aliya! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function.

Hello, Aliya! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook.

Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Types of variables in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;APCSP Group&quot;); // String logItType(2022); // Number logItType([&quot;Aliya&quot;, &quot;Ananya&quot;, &quot;Claire&quot;, &quot;Sreeja&quot;]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

If you want to go far, go together.” -African Proverb | . | . 1.1 Daily Video 2 - Collaboration Computing innovations are imrpoved through collaborations. Computing innovations are developed by groups of people. . Example: Collaborate in class: - Pair programming: one programmer writes code and one reviews each line, checking for any mistakes or giving any suggestions - Think-Pair-Share: student thinks through problem alone, then pairs up with a partner to share ideas, then shares results with the whole class . - Leave comments in code: - communicate to partners and yourself - acknowledge code segments and media used from other sources - differentiate you and your partners work - clarify the functionality of your code Online Tools for collaboration: - repl.it: multiplayer - GitHub: collaboration and repostiory - Shared document or folder - Note: Check with your teacher about your coding platform . Takeaways: Consulting with other people is important, as you can get multiple perspectives and what others think about your program (you may miss your own faults and mistakes) There are many online tools you can find by searching, see what works best for you and your partner. :) . Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests? . No, not stricly. Though I first joined my group because I was former classmates of some of the members, I think this allows us to work well together and communicate. | . Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives? . Yes, my group has diverse backgrounds and perspectives. These differences allow us combine multiple different ideas and help when others make mistakes. | . Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom? . I think my group has many different skill sets that prove useful when collaborating. Even if we don’t have a certain skill set or run into a problem, we are able to figure it out together. | .",

Overall, I found it helpful to mostly stick with the blocks, and occasionally switch to text mode and compare the blocks and the actual code to get familiar with it. . | A specific problem I ran into while coding my App Lab was the text input part where a user inputs an answer to the question. I needed to check if the answer inputted is correct. I tried out several different blocks and block combinations until I found something that worked. I also searched online for JavaScript syntax to compare to the text version of my code. . | Another specific problem was the if/else statement that was used to check if the user&#39;s inputted answer is correct (ex: if the text input = &quot;answer&quot;, then... else: then...). I wanted to add two different answers that were very similar in the &#39;if&#39; part.

As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. .

Alternate methods for iteration . In coding, there are usually many wasy to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustratng using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . While Loop . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . In the code below, the while loop outputs the information about the pets. The program doesn&#39;t end as long as the variable number (i) is less than the length of the InfoDb list. . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Recursion . The code below prints information about the pets with recursion by calling itself repeatedly. The progam ends once the i value exceeds the length of the InfoDb length, just like the while loop. . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

            "title": "Alumni Panel Takeaways",
            "content": "One of my biggest takeaways from today’s Alumni Panel is how useful taking APCSA and APCSP can prove to be. Even though the alumni all took APCSP and/or APCSA, many of them didn’t specifically major in computer science. Some majored in cognitive science, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, and more, but they all used some aspects of computer science in their major. Furthermore, knowledge of computer science can open so many opportunities that wouldn’t have been possible without it, for example the alumni who did internships despite not being in a computer science major. Specifically, I took notice of Mabel who got an internship at Northrop Grumman where she analyzed flight data which was possible just because she took APCSA. This really shows how APCSP and APCSA is useful even just as basic skill and knowledge, and knowing the foundations can be really helpful as the world becomes more technologically driven. . Another takeaway was the fact that you should actually try and learn instead of cutting corners and just focusing on grades. I feel like so many students nowadays are grade oriented and don’t actually focus on actually learning the material and taking it to heart, and not just in this CSP class. As many of the alumni said, this could be due to several different reasons such as competitiveness among students, pressure from parents, and more. They made several good points that you shouldn’t let others discourage you and that you should focus on your own learning path. This helped open my eyes and reinforce the fact that I should take this class seriously and not give up, especially considering how important it is as stated in my first takeaway. Similarly to Nitya, I have been interested in computer programming and STEM since a very young age, so what the alumni mentioned helped remind me that I’m taking this class because I am interested in expanding my knowledge of computer science, not just for a grade. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

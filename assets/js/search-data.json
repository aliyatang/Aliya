            "content": "Database Programming is Program with Data . Each Tri 2 Final Project should be an example of a Program with Data. . Prepare to use SQLite in common Imperative Technique . Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | What are the Data Types in SQL table? | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;files/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() . Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? | Same for cursor object? | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() . Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. | In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction? | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. | . | . Reference... sqlite documentation .",

            "content": "Take some additional notes that you would like here for 3.12 and 3.13. We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . need to examine code line by line to determine what a procedure does | proceude may or may not produce value | proceudre needs to be defined and called | proceudral abstracation: only know what is not done, not how | . What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values, can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: change the actions if there is an error in the code . Procedural Abstraction: type of abstraction which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: modularity 12222222 5 . Why are procedures effective?: ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program, convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity) . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . x = 7 nums = [] def convertToBinary(x): if x &gt;= 1 and x &lt;= 255: while x/2 != 0: rem = x % 2 nums.append(rem) x = int(x/2) nums.reverse() binary = &quot; &quot; for i in nums: binary = binary + str(i) return binary else: print(&quot;Number not within range.&quot;) print(str(x) + &quot; to binary: &quot; + convertToBinary(x)) ## Function called here . 7 to binary: 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . function findMax(numA, numB) { if (numA &gt; numB) { max = numA min = numB } else if (numA &lt; numB) { max = numB min = numA } else { console.log(&quot;Numbers are equal.&quot;) } console.log(&quot;The max is &quot; + max) console.log(&quot;The min is &quot; + min) } findMax(4, 5) . The max is 5 The min is 4 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def decToBin(x): nums = [] while x/2 != 0: rem = x % 2 nums.append(rem) x = int(x/2) nums.append(0) nums.reverse() binary = &quot; &quot; for i in nums: binary = binary + str(i) print(binary) return binary def charToBin(x): num_list = [] for i in x: num_list.append(decToBin(ord(i))) print(x + &quot;to binary:&quot; + str(num_list)) charToBin(&quot;APCSP&quot;) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get . 01000001 01010000 01000011 01010011 01010000 APCSPto binary:[&#39; 01000001&#39;, &#39; 01010000&#39;, &#39; 01000011&#39;, &#39; 01010011&#39;, &#39; 01010000&#39;] .",

Initially with this program, I thought that the robot would get stuck in the middle and go around in infinite loops. Upon closer look, that only happens for grid 2, because it gets to a point where the robot can move forward, left, or right and it gets stuck in a the repeat until loop forever. . Q26 . The algorithm should be D, as it selects 1 student from the group fo 30 then selects another from the remaining 29 students, allowing for any possible pair of students to be sleected. The one I chose spilts the class in half, and doesn’t allow for any possible pair of students to be chosen. . Q35 . Program B doesn’t identify the correct winner team for all the situations, for example if scoreA is greater than scoreC which is greater than scoreB. In this case, it identifys Team C instead of Team A as the winner. The correct program is A, where all the test cases work. . Q43 . Since “happy” is displayed in proc1 and proc1 is before display(str1) in proc2, the “happy” should be before the “birthday”. Thus, the right answer should be D, which is “to you happy birthday”. Simple mistake… . Q48 . For this one, I didn’t select 2 answers. The other answer along with the one I chose should be that the simulation can be used to model real-world events that are impracticlef or epxeriments. Simple mistake… . Problems I struggled with . Q2 . There is much user information in browser cookies, so if it is used by websites that the user visits, the user can be tracked and information can be collected on them. This is the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy compared to the other options. The IP address doesn’t contain extra information about the user besides the address of the user’s computer that is required for the user to send and recieve info on the internet. The user’s email address can be ocnsidered personal, but overall it is pretty public and doesn’t contain any extra information about the user. The public key is posted for others to use and it is meant to be public and doesn’t compromise personal privacy. . Q13 . For options 1 and 3, the Creative Commons liscence would be good. This is because this liscense increases the amount of content avaible to the public for free. In options 1 and 3, the author encourages people to use and spread their content, while in option 2 the author doesn’t want it to be spread. . Q23 . When 5 and 3 are added, the result is 8, which is 1000 in binary. Since it onlyd5 uses 3 bits to represented integers, 1000 can’t be stored since it is 4 digits. Thus, there are too many digits and an error occurs, which is called an overflow error. . Reflect on problems: . I definetly need to review the sample program problems where it asks which program is correct or what the output is the program is. The problem itself isn’t too hard, but there are many components that you can get mixed up. Next time or on the AP test, it owuld definitely be helpful to have scratch paper to write down the steps so I can see it in front of me visually. Also, I think I just have to be more thorough when reading the problem, answer, or sample program. Many of the mistakes I made could have been easily avoidable if I just took some time to reread the content more carefully. .",

            "content": "Video Guide . Click Here . Purpose and Function . The purpose of this feature is for users to be entertained and improve their English vocabulary skills as they play a word guessing game. It functions by taking the 5 letter input of the user, and outputting different colors to indicate the similiarity of the input with the correct answer. Users can also document their wordle scores to compare their scores with others on the leaderboard, and delete with a pin authentification if needed. . Input and Output . The input of the program is in two main different forms, there is an input for the wordle 5-letter word. If there is an input which is a not 5 letters and/or a real word, an error message pops up. The output is the score updating, and the letters of the gussed word changing color according to the unknown correct word. Green indicates that the respective letter is in the right spot, yellow indicates that the letter is in the word but not in the right spot, and grey means that it is not in the word at all. There is also the input for multiple attributes (name, pin, score) by submitting text into inputs on the frontend. The output is an error alert if the fields are not filled in correctly, or the presence of the submission input in the frontend database table. . Data Abstraction . The list “WORDS” is shown above, it contains all the possible words that could be randomly selected as the unknown correct guess. . Here is the list “WORDS” being used to randomly select the unknown correct. . Managing Complexity . The code segment above show sthe list “WORDS”, which manages complexity int he program as it contains thousands of words in one location variable. The list is needed, as without it, all the variables would be stored into seperate variables which would result in thousands of different variables. That is very impractical and hard to manage in comparison to stroing the words all in one list location. . Procedural Abstraction . This code segment shows the algorithm for function “shadeKeyBoard” with the parameters “letter” and “letterColor”. . The “shadeKeyBoard” function is being called within another function, when the letter in the guessed words similarity with the actual word is found. . “shadeKeyBoard” contributes to the overall function as the program, as it allows for the users inputted guess to be checked to see the similarity between the actual unknown word to be guessed by letting the letter box color be outputted and updated in the keyboard. This allows for the user to easily see what letters have already been guessed and what the status of each of their letters is in the keyboard on the user interface. Overall, it makes it much easier and more efficient for the user to play the game and for it to continue on. . Algorithm Implementation . The function “shadeKeyBoard” contains iteration (for loop), sequencing and selection (if statements). First, it uses a for loop to iterate through each of the keyboard buttons on the user interface. For each button, it uses sequencing with the if statements to check if the letter on the keyboard is equal to the one that is entered and being checked. Selection as it only allows for the program to continue on if this condition is met. If this condition is met, more if statements check the color of the keyboard letter to see if it needs to be updated. The first if sttaement is if the “oldColor”, or previous color of the keyboard letter equals green. If it is green, the keyboard letter color will still remain green. Next, if the “oldColor” equals yellow and the new color isn’t equal to green, it returns yellow and the keyboard letter color remains yellow. . Testing . First call: “shadeKeyBoard” is called when the user presses enter and the keyboard buttons check the letters they enter, using the “letter” parameter. . Second call: “shadeKeyBoard” is called when the user presses enter and the boxes need to be reshaded as they got new letter colors. Specifically, if the first letter color is yellow and now the correct letter is in the correct spot, using the “color” parameter. . Condition(s) tested by first call: The first call tests to see what letters are guessed and where they may possibly be need to be updated on the user interface keyboard. . Condition(s) tested by the second call: The second call tests to see if the old color of the keyboard letter is yellow and if the new color isn’t green. . Results of the first call: The letters from the user’s guess is tested, allowing for the correct letters color boxes to be tested and updated. The accuracy of each letter from the users guess can be updated. . Results of the second call: The accuracy and the similarity of the letter is tested. The previous color of the specific key is yellow, and remains yellow, allowing the status of this specific letter to be accurate and updated for the user. .",

My Wordle game was pretty popular, as it was a game that a lot of people recognized and could be played an unlimited amount of times. However, many people overlooked the leaderboard function, so that would be something I should work on more to incorporate into the Wordle part of the project more. My group member’s projects were also a success, many people enjoyed the RPG game and thought it was fun to experiment with the reviews and events databases. Tanisha’s reviews database had a small issue where people could rate above 5 stars and mess up the rating, but she fixed this quickly after. Here is a pic of our group: . Other CS Projects .

Besides presenting our project, receiving feedback on it, and checking out other CS projects, I was also able to walk around to see the other classes projects/pieces. Some of the ones I saw included mixed media, ceramics, photography, 3d animation, and jazz band: . I especially liked the ceramics and mixed media pieces.

I’m not completely familiar with decimal/hexadecimal/binary/ascii etc conversion. The way I did this was by first trying to conver the hexadecimal 56 to decimal. I did this by dividing 56 by seeing which of the decimal numbers divided by 16 was the closest to 5. 80 divided by 16 is 5. So, I now know that 80 hexidecimal in decimal is 50 (5*10). Then I just added 6 to 50 because 86-80 is 6. So the decimal of 86 hexidecimal is 56, which is V on the table.

Certain technologies such as UAVs/Drones and OpenAI/ChatGPT may have many benefits, but there can also be many negative effects as well | UAVs/Drones have benefits such as search and rescue, aerial photography, hobbies, etc. However, there are negatives such as environmental damage, privacy issues, etc. | OpenAi/ChatGPT can be useful and efficient for certain tasks, but there are negatives such as providing false information, promoting laziness, and causing a platform shift for things like Google | Games and social media can have positive and negative effects on people | Both of them are a good way to stay connected with others or make new friends | Both games and social media increase dopamine, making people feel happy, but this can lead to addiction and people may “waste time”, neglect their needs and other activities like self care and school, etc | Both games and social media are a hotspot of cyberbullying because the interactions are online | Social media is also a projection of peoples best moments and it is really fake, it can cause people to feel insecure | Social media is linked with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, etc | . Reflection . Question 1 . Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing: . Enhanced commmunication and access to information -&gt; data security and privacy concerns | Increased efficiency and productivity while doing certain tasks -&gt; dependence on technology and loss of tradictional skills | Increased convenience and improved quality of life through technology -&gt; widening digital divide and socioeconomic inequality | . Question 2 . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . I think dopamine issues above are real. Social media and games are designed to be addicting so they can attract people and keep those people interested. Personally, there have been many times where I feel distracted by social medias such as Instagram and Tiktok and I find it hard to focus on my studies. | . Big Idea 5.2 - Digital Divide . Discussion Summary . Widening digital divide in today’s society, differerences in computers, internet, or tehcnology in general | Factors that contribute to divide include socioeconomic (money) geographic (location, and demographic (education, nationality, religion, and etnicity) | Many things, such as education, requires school to provide materials like computers or chrombooks for equity | . Reflection . Question 1 . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Someone can empower themself in a digital world by engaging with the digital world. For example, they can participate in online communities and social media, stay informed about digital trends, updates in technology, etc, and they can learn digital skills such as coding, digital marketing, etc. | . Question 2 . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone empowered could help someone that is not empowered by informing them about certain information about the digital world. For example, someone might wnat to learn more about digital skills but might not know how. I could help teach them some or inform them about certain clubs and classes they could partake in, such as coding clubs, AP CSP/CSA, etc. | . Question 3 . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Digital empowerment is blocked at different levels in different areas of the world or community, depending on how much that certain place as access to computers, internet, technology, etc. At Del Norte, I think the school does a good job at overcoming some of the barriers of blocked digital empowerment by providing chromebooks. However, there are some barriers that block digital empowerment for those who don’t have as much access to technology such as phones. | . Week 21 . Big Idea 5.3 - Computing Bias . Summary/thoughts/conclusions . Intentional or purposeful bias: . Occurs when there is a specific agenda, interest or preference that affects judgment or decision making process | Results in distorted or skewed representation of information/data | Can have negative consequences for indivudals or groups affected by it | . Tiktok and Facebook have different age groups - tiktok is mainly used by younger audiences and facebook older audeinces. This can result in purposeful exclusion on the platforms, for example specific advertisements or content being displayed that appeal to only the certain age group that uses the platform. This is good business, as it keeps those age groups that already use the platform engaged and encourages them to keep on using the app. I don’t think it is too harmful, as they are just trying to do good business and it isn’t really enforcing any harmful ideas. It could even be benefitial, for example, Facebook could display more mature content that would interest the older audience, but if displayed on Tiktok for the younger audience it could harm them. . Virtual assitants such as Amazon, Alexa, and Apple siri have female voices. This could be purposeful, as it could appeal to audiences more, for example people could think that a female voice would sound more comforting or motherly. By making the voices female, it is good business as a female voice is what many are already used to or find comfort in. It could be harmful as it promotes that women are supposed to take on the assitant role, while men are generally in the higher positions ordering women around. . Companies such as Netflix and Amazon have algorithms that influence decisions. They can take previous data and see what you might be interested in, then display it to influence or encourage you into using the app more. For example, they both look at previously looked at or watched and searched up content and displays similar content to you. Also, Netflix even takes that and displays how much you would like something with its percentage match feature so it’s easier for the user to make a decision on what they want to watch. . HP computers are racist? - The HP computers face detection could detect a white person but couldn’t detect a black person. The owner of the computer thinks it was intentional, but it porobably wasn’t. This probably happened because there wasn’t enough data about faces for the face detection to be able to detect certain faces. For example, when testing the face detection device, they could have only tested white people. As a result, the face detetction device couldn’t detect someone who wasn’t a white person. Even if it wasn’t intentional, it is definitely harmful and excludes certain people. To avoid this problem, HP could have tested more people for their face detection device so it wouldn’t exclude anyone, and so they caught the problem before releasing the product. . Why we should avoid bias in algorithms or code we write: . Lead to unequal or unfair outcomes | Inaccurate or incorrect results | Diminish trustworthiness | . Big Idea 5.4 - Crowdsourcing . Crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining services, ideas, or content by enlisting the services of a large number of people typically through the internet. Many companies use crowdsourcing as a way to gather information, solve problems, or generate new ideas. . Use of crowdsourcing in my project: A crowdsource idea to collect data from the 150 students in the CSP classes could be a google form or other type of form that is assigned through Slack and that all the students can fill out. We could get feedback, suggestions, and comments on our project’s games and other features. This can help improve our projects from the user perspective or help us find solutions to problems. . Crowdsourcing could help our project improve as it gives us multiple perspectives on it, which can help us find solutions to problems and improvements that we can make. For example, the Events and Review databases could be tested and provided feedback by more people, allowing the filter and validation system to be tested more and insured that it is all working. The same goes for the games Wordle and RPG Cat Game, as having more tests and feedback allow for the game to be fully tested to be correct with certain words being filtered out, and ideal for the user. So, crowdsourcing with all of Del Norte with many more students would be ideal. . Week 22 . Big Idea 5.5 - Legal and Ethical Concerns . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog: There are several types of liscenses, and each is different regarding what they protect and focus on. The ones our team looked at and decided fit our project best is the Open Source MIT liscense. We chose this as it is the most flexible liscense, as it allows our original work to be used as long as we are credited. We want others to be able to use our website and software, as it can provide a framework to others; since our website is a cat cafe, other people looking to make a website for a restaurant, cafe, etc can reference or use our work. . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic: Copyright and software licenses can have benfits and harms. Some postives of copyright and liscenses are that owners are rightfully credited for their work. This way, their digital rights will not be violated because stealing and/or misuing their work is illegal. This is important because it is just for the owner of a piece of work that they put time into to create to have a say in where it is being displayed, used for, etc. For example, I’ve seen the stealing and misuse of work, such as art, many times on social media and it goes unnoticed or the owner can’t legally do anything because it isn’t copyrighted. There are also some negatives of copyright, such as exploiting copyright rights, overall limiting the use of referencing or borrowing work and ideas, and more. We can also avoid our work getting stolen and protect it, even with Github, with liscences. . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update: Our group is using the MIT liscense, since our website is overall meant to provide a framework for the user/public. See image of our liscense below: . | . Big Idea 5.6 - Safe Computing . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles: Some examples of PII that I have seen in projects in CSP are ones that ask for a name, for surveys, sign ins, etc. For example, in our project, for our events and reviews database, it asks for name, email, and phone number, which is all pretty personal information. Though it is tehcnically a simulation, this reflects real life situations where event and reviews sections ask for personal information in order to make a request/post. . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure: I feel like there is a lot of PII online and I would want my information to be protected. I wouldn’t want my personal information such as my picture or phone number for strangers, whether they have bad intent or not, to just have access to. For me, since I am still young, when I search my name up there is nothing that comes up for me. However, when I search up adults such as my parents, a lot of information comes up about them, such as their linkedIn or social medias. . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication: Generally, a good password has complexity(symbols such as * and ^, upper and lowercase letters, numbers), randomness(no spelled out words, no words in relation to you), and length (longer than 8 characters). A bad password is short, simple, and predictable. For example, “password” or your pet’s name. A good password is crucial as it is the line of defense against access to personal information on a computer or other device, account, etc, by hackers and malware. This is why there are multiple steps to authenticate whether the person logging in is the correct person or not a robot. These steps can include sending authentication codes or checks to your linked emails, phone numbers, or devices. . | Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption: Symetteric encyrption uses the same one key to encrypt AND decrypt data. On the other hand, asymmetric encyrption uses two different keys, a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt data. . | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment: An example of encryption we used was the key we used with AES-256 encyrption. . | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques: I have encountered many phishing scenes. For example, when I go on certain unofficial or “sketchy” websites, there are several times where my device just pops up a screen that looks like an error message or tells me that my device has a virus. Personally, nothing further has happened with this (yet), because every time I see that I immediately close out of the website, however, the first time I saw it I was a bit worried that my device actually had a problem. Some other phishing techniques are through email and screen-popups to scam and trick people into entering information or paying for something. . | .",

            "content": "For the College Board performance task, we need to have a project that meets all the parameters. We also need video demonstration and written response that showcases our program purpose and functionaliy, data abstraction, managing complexity, procedural abstraction, algorithm implementation, and testing. This outline with the college board requirements will help with better planning and make sure that I meet all the requirements. . Feature Description . Wordle inspired game . Purpose and Function . The purpose of this feature is for users to be entertained and improve their English vocabulary skills as they play a word guessing game. It functions by taking the 5 letter input of the user, and outputting different colors to indicate the similiarity of the input with the correct answer. . Code Plan . Data Abstraction . The code uses data abstraction as it stores 5-letter words in a list. These words in the list are used for generating the final correct guessed word, and for words that are valid input guesses for the user. . Managing Complexity . The list that contains the words allows for all the possible words to be selected for the final correct guess or check if the user guess is a valid word to be stored in one place. Without it, the words would have to all be stored in multiple different variables instead of one place, which is not ideal and impractical. . Procedural Abstraction . I will have a procedure that checks how similar the correct word and the inputted user guess is, which overall determines if the user wins or not or what colors should be displayed to indicate the position of that letter. There will be two parameters, one being the correct word, and one being the inputted user guess. . Algorithm Implementation . The procedure will use sequencing, selection, and iteration. It will use sequencing to carry out the different checks, first to see if the word is the same, then if the letter is same or in the word, etc. Selection is used: if and only if the word is the same as the final correct word, it will display that the user has won. Iteration will be used as it iterates through each letter to check for the similarity with the final correct word. . Testing . The first call will be checking an inputted incorrect word with at least one letter that isn’t in the word at all (grey), at least one letter that is in the word but not in the correct spot (yellow), and at least one letter that is in the word in the correct spot (green). The second call will be checking an inputted word that is completely correct and completely matches the final correct word (all green). .",

            "content": "What is debugging? . Debugging, in computer programming and engineering, is a multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it. The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works. . Why is debugging important? . Debugging is important in programming because it helps ensure that a program is functioning correctly and is free of errors. When a program contains bugs or errors, it can produce unexpected results or crash, which can lead to lost time and resources trying to fix the problem. Debugging allows developers to identify and fix these errors before a program is released, which can improve the overall quality and reliability of the program, and ultimately save time and resources in the long run. Additionally, debugging also helps in understanding the code and how it works, and can also help in finding and fixing security vulnerabilities. . Common coding errors . Examples of common coding erros include: . Syntax error | Runtime error | Semantic error | Logic error | Disregarding adopted conventions in the coding standard | Calling the wrong function | Using the wrong variable name in the wrong place | Failing to initialize a variable when absolutely required | Skipping a check for an error return | . How to debug . To debug a Python script in VSCODE, you can select the down-arrow next to the run button on the editor and select Debug Python File in Terminal. . To debug a web application using Flask, Django or FastAPI, the Python extension provides dynamically created debug configurations based on your project structure under the Show all automatic debug configurations option, through the Run and Debug view . . To debug other kinds of applications, you can start the debugger through the Run view by clicking on the Run and Debug button. . Basics . Dynamic analysis, execution, stepping, brekapoints and exceptions, modying execution, runtime error debugging, logical error debugging . Errors I’ve Run Into .

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 1 | Requirements met - The program has the input of the triangle side lengths and output of the information about the triangle, including classifcation of the triangle, degrees of each angle, trigonemetric values, etc. They also mention the program purpose and functinality, which is to help with information about triangles based on inputted side lengths. | 0 | Requirements not met - The described purpose, to provide information about a triange, is actually the functionality of the program. They only described the functionality and not the purpose. This is something to take note of in my own project, as I feel that purpose and function may be hard to differentiate between if not careful. | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - The program meets the requirements of two code segments. For example, one is how they implement and identify sideIndex, which stores the data of the types of triangle. Second, they use sideIndex in the program to fulfill the program and identify and output what triangle it is based on the input. | 1 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 0 | Requirements not met - This program does not manage complexity well. In the written response, the code uses a list that has all the classifcations under one variable(sideIndex), when ideally this is not needed because they could just use strings instead of lists. So, their written response explanation does not show how they manage complexity either. | 0 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - The student-developed procedure(ratioCalculate) has three parameters that effects how they are ordered for the ratio. This procedure is also being called. They also describe what the procedure does, which is to calcualte the ratio fo the triangle sidelengths to store as values in sideRatio. | 1 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - The student developed an algorithm(ratioCalculate) that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. They also describe how the algorithm works in a lot of detail. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 1 | Requirements met - They describe two calls to the procedure ratioCalculate, the conditions being tested, and the results of each call. | 1 | None | . Submission 2 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 1 | Requirements met - The program has an input of the users clicking to result in the outputs, for example the choice to remove tiles on the grid and control the simulation(pause, restart, reset, etc). The program function and purpose are both identified, with the function as an interactive simulation and its purpose as serving entertainment for the user. | 1 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - They store data in several lists, (startGrid, currentGrid, nextGrid) and successfully show and describe that they use these to fulfill the part of the program which is to store data about the cells. | 1 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 1 | Requirements met - The program shows how the list manages complexity of the data about the cells, and also explains why are list is necessary to manage complexity in this situation as it is the most efficient to have everything in one place. | 1 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - They have two program code segments, one that shows the student-developed procedure(replaceList) that includes the two parameters(current, replacement), and also calls the procedure. They also describe the functionality of the procedure, which is to take inputs identifying numbers for two lists and replace have the first replace the second while still being able to recall the previous points. | 1 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - It includes a pogram code segment of a student-developed algorithm, replaceList, which includes sequ4encing, selection, and iteration. They also explain how this algorithm works, which is using if-else statements to see which list should be copied from. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 1 | Requirements met - They describe two calls to the selected procedure, one is to reset everything and another is to be used during the main generation to define the current and replacements, the conditions being used in these calls, and the results of each. | 1 | None | . Note: Submission 1 is an example of a lacking Create Preformance Task with multiple missing requirements, while Submission 2 is an example of a good one. I could look back on this for reference on mine as it could be very helpful in seeing what should be done and what shouldn’t. . Scoring 2 - Week 18 . Submission 1 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 0 | Requirements not met - In the written response, they identified the wrong input and output. The student said the input was the user getting asked what the animal was, but it should be the user typing in their answer to what the animal was. They said the output was the user typing in the answer, but it should be the screen telling them whether they got the answer right or not based on the what they answered from input. Also, they failed to mention the purpose of the program, only stating that the functionality was to be shown and identifying animals | 0 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 0 | Requirements not met - The student identifies the lists &quot;animalImages&quot; and &quot;animalList&quot; in two code segments but they don&#39;t show them using these lists in either of the code segments. They do describe what data is contained in the list though, one is the animal names and one the the picture of the animals corresponding to those names. | 0 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 1 | Requirements met - They manage complexity well with their list &quot;animaList&quot; and in their written response explain that how the list manages complexity by being able to store the variables. | 0 | Requirements not met - The list actually doesn&#39;t manage complexity and the code is not complex, and the written response doesn&#39;t explain why their code would manage complexity. They only state that a list storing more than one variable makes it shorter and more complex, which is not true. | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 0 | Requirements not met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;evaluateGuess&quot;, with the parameter &quot;guess&quot; and them calling this parameter. However, nt he writtten response they don&#39;t say how this specific procedure contributes to the functionality, they only say that it determines if the users guess is right or wrong. | 0 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 0 | Requirements not met - Though they have a student-devleoped algorith, &quot;evuluateGuess&quot;, that has sequencing and iteration, a for loop, and selection, if else statement, their response doesn&#39;t explain this well in enough detail. | 0 | None | . 6 | Testing | 1 | Requirements met - They describe two calls, a right and a wrong call, to the procedure &quot;evuluateGuess&quot;, the conditionas being tested, and the results of each call, getting a point or a strike. | 1 | None | . Submission 2 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 1 | Requirements met - In the written response, they identify the input and output. The input is the users input of words such as pine and star, and the output is the generation of the poems. They also mention the program purpose and function, the purpose being to explore the users creativity and the function being to generate poems based on the user input. | 1 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - The student identifies the list &quot;nounList&quot; in the two code segments and mention how they are called and used in the program in the procedure &quot;selectWord&quot; as parameter &quot;wordList&quot;. They also identify what is being stored in the list, which are the nouns that should be in specific locations in the poem so the poem is in an order that makes sense. | 1 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 1 | Requirements met - In the repsonse they explain how the code uses lists of words to manage complexity. They say that they need this list because it can randomly select multiple nouns at once and store all of them in one list instead of multiple variables. They also say that they need this list otherwise they would have to find another way to randomize selection and the code would be very unorganized. | 1 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;createPoems&quot;, with the multiple, four, parameters that are used. They also show how this procedure contributes to the overall function by putting the final selection of the poems together and stating that is in relation with the user inputs based on how many the user inputted and if they wanted articles in the poems. | 1 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - They have a student-devleoped algorith, &quot;createPoems&quot;, that has sequencing and iteration, a while loop, and selection, an if else statement, and their response explains this well in enough detail. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 1 | Requirements met - They describe two calls, &quot;createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 1)&quot; and &quot;createPoems(nounList, verbList, adverbList, 0)&quot;, on what they do, checking &quot;aSetting&quot; in different ways, and the results of each call, generating peosm from &quot;aritclePoem&quot; or &quot;noArticlePoem&quot;. | 1 | None | . Submission 3 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 0 | Requirements not met - In the written response, they identify the input and output. The input is the users selection of the characters from the dropdown box, and the output is the display changing based on the selected character and the winner screen. However, they fail to mention the program purpose and only mention the function, stating that the program aims to the determine the winner of a hypothetical fight. | 0 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - The student identifies the list &quot;firstCharacterList&quot; in the two code segments and mention how it is used for the purpose of the program as the first parameter of the function &quot;findWinner&quot;. They also identify what is being stored in the list, which are the power rankings and the images for the selected character. | 1 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 1 | Requirements met - In the repsonse they explain how the code uses lists of ranking and images to manage complexity. They say that they need this list because it allows for information about the character to be stored in one variable instead of multiple to hekp organize and shorten the code needed for the program. They also explain that without it, there would be many parameters needed for &quot;findWinner&quot; function. | 1 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;findWinner&quot;, with the multiple, two, parameters that are used and they show that they call this procedure. They also show how this procedure contributes to the overall function by stating that the function takes in the characterList to compare the ranings and find the winner. | 1 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - They have a student-devleoped algorithm, &quot;findWinner&quot;, that has sequencing, if else statement, and iteration, a for loop, and their response explains this well in enough detail. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 1 | Requirements met - They describe two calls, one that uses the arguments Vision and Bishop and another that uses the arguments Carnage and Venom. They also show what is tested by each call, the different parts of the if else statement, and the results of each call, the different displays of image and text of who won. | 1 | None | . Submission 4 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 1 | Requirements met - In the written response, they identify the input and output. The input is the users clicking buttons and inputting/entering words into the text box, and the output is the color scheme of the inputted letters to be displayed. They also mention both the function, which is to have users guess 8 letter words, and the purpose, to challenge the player. | 1 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 0 | Requirements not met - The student identifies the list &quot;guesses&quot; in the two code segments and show the storage of data in this list, but fail to show them using the data in this list. | 0 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 1 | Requirements met - The program has the list &quot;guesses&quot; in the code segment and it helps manage complexity by counting the number of guesses, and they also explain why they need this because they need to know when the program ends, when the user guesses six times, or else it will continue forever. | 0 | Requirements not met - The program has the list &quot;guesses&quot; in the code segment but it doesn&#39;t manage complexity as just counts. They also don&#39;t explain how it manages complexity, because they just say that the guesses functon is to stop the program when the user has guessed six times when they could just use a counter. | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;isitcorrect&quot;, with one parameter, &quot;checkanswer&quot; that is used and they show that they call this procedure in the second code segment with the argument &quot;answer&quot;. They also show how this procedure contributes to the overall function by stating that procedure ehelps determine if the answer matches the correct word of letter position for the user input. | 1 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - They have a student-devleoped algorithm, &quot;isitcorrect&quot;, that has sequencing and selection, if else statement, and iteration, a repeat loop, and their response explains this well in enough detail. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 0 | Requirements not met - They describe two calls, one that has both the right letter and rigt position and another that has the right letter but wrong position. They also show thhe conditions and the results of each call, the color changing of the letter. However, these calls cause the same segment of code in the algorithm to execute. | 0 | None | . Scoring 3 - Week 19 . Submission 1 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 1 | Requirements met - In the written response, they identify the input and output. The input is the users choice of rock paper, or scissors, and the output is if they win, lose, or draw. They also mention the program function and purpose. The function is said to be to output the relationships of the diffferent combinations of rock paper and scissors, and the purpose is said to be entertainment and can be used to make a decision for the user. | 1 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - The student identifies the list &quot;RPS&quot; in the two code segments and mention how it is used for the purpose of the program to determine what combinations of rock papers and scissors wins/loses/draws. They also identify what is being stored in the list, which are rock paper and scissors. | 0 | Requirements note met - The student met all the requirements except for the second segment does not show data being accessed from the list. They do not reference the RPS list at all. | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 0 | Requirements not met - In the repsonse they show the list &quot;RPS&quot;, but this list doesn&#39;t manage complexity in the program. They can achieve the same thing without the list by putting the values directly into &quot;cpuPlay&quot;. They say that they need this list because the program can only function with the list &quot;RPS&quot;, without it, each potential computer input would need to responc to a number and then it would pick a number. However, this would work just as well, showing that they don&#39;t need list &quot;RPS&quot;. | 0 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 0 | Requirements not met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;rpsGame&quot;, with the one parameter that is used and they show that they call this procedure. However they don&#39;t explain how this procedure contributes to the overall function, they only state that it allows for hte program to execute smoothly. . | 0 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - They have a student-devleoped algorithm, &quot;rpsGame&quot;, that has sequencing, if else statement, and iteration, recursion, and their response explains this well in enough detail to be recreated. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 1 | Requirements met - They describe two calls, one that uses uses &quot;yourPlay&quot; with value &quot;Rock&quot; and computer input &quot;Paper&quot;, and another that uses &quot;yourPlay&quot; with value &quot;Paper&quot; and computer input &quot;Rock&quot;. They also show what is tested by each call, the different parts of the if else statement seeing the combinations of Rock and Paper, and the results of each call, the display of &quot;You Lose&quot; or &quot;Your Win&quot;. | 1 | None | . Submission 2 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 1 | Requirements met - In the written response, they identify the input and output. The input is the users choice of rock paper, or scissors, and the output is if they win, lose, or draw. They mention the program function, to input letters and output the letter wehre it belongs in a randomly generated word, and the purpose, to expand the users vocab and let them recognize new words. | 1 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - The student identifies the list &quot;letOfGuessWord&quot; in the two code segments and mention how it is used for the purpose of the program as data is being taken from the list in the for loop. They also identify what is being stored in the list, which is the indivdual letters of the word that the user tries to guess. | 1 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 1 | Requirements met - In the repsonse they explain how the code uses lists to store the letters of the word to manage complexity. They say that they need this list because otherwise the code would be very inefficient becasue there would have to be 5 new variables ot be stored in the individual letters, which would also make the loop more complicated. | 1 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;guessWords&quot;, with one parameter that are used and they show that they call this procedure. They also show how this procedure contributes to the overall function by stating that a letter will pop up in the space or it will take a life away from the user. | 1 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - They have a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;guessWords&quot;, that has sequencing, if else statement, and iteration, a for loop, and their response explains this well in enough detail to be recreated, explaining both the if else statement and foor loop and what they do. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 1 | Requirements met - They describe two calls, one that uses input of &quot;1&quot; and one of letter &quot;h&quot; by the user and guesses &quot;hello&quot;. They also show what is tested by each call, how &quot;1&quot; is not in &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;h&quot; is in &quot;hello&quot;, and the results of each call, saying the first call is false and the second call is true. | 1 | None | .

The input is the users choice of the state, and the output is the the general information about that state. They also mention both the function and the purpose. The function is to hprovide the user with information about a U.S. state, and the purpose is to help the user with memorzation or just be used to learn something new. | 1 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 0 | Requirements not met - The student identifies the list &quot;stateList&quot;, but it is not shown to be used in either of the two code segments. They do mention how it is used for the purpose of the program as it contains the general information about the state. | 0 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 0 | Requirements not met - In the repsonse they explain how the code manages complexity. They say that they need this list because, but they don&#39;t explain why their code needs a list. They only say that it would be very inefficient and take a long time to run, which is very vague. | 0 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 0 | Requirements not met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;updateScreen&quot;, but it has no parameter. They also don&#39;t show how this procedure contributes to the overall function, they say that the state screen would be updated but the procedure doesn&#39;t do that. | 0 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - They have a student-devleoped algorithm, &quot;updateScreen&quot;, that has sequencing, if else statement. Their response explains it in well enough detail to show how the &quot;updateScreen&quot; algorithm works. | 0 | The procedure &quot;updateScreen&quot; does not include iteration, and it only partiall explains how the alrogthm &quot;updateScreen&quot; works. | . 6 | Testing | 0 | Requirements met - They describe two calls, one that calls &quot;stateInput&quot; to update the screen by pressing the go button and another that calls &quot;stateInput&quot; to display more information by prssing the drop down. They also show what is tested by each call, the display of information for the desired state and the extra information. | 0 | They actually described two calls FROM the prodcedure instead of two calls TO the procedure, and they don&#39;t have a prarmeter. They weren&#39;t supposed to describe two sepearte operation being preformed, they were supposed to do onditions being tested by the given parameter. | . Submission 4 . Row Category My Score Score Reason CB Score Score Discrepancies . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | 1 | Requirements met - In the response, they identify the input and output. The input is the users pressing the &#39;a&#39;,&#39;d&#39;, spacebar, etc keys, and the output is the boat&#39;s movement, They also explain the function and urpose of the program, the function is to control the gameplay of the boat with keys, and the purpose is to lessen boredom fot he user. | 1 | None | . 2 | Data Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - The student identifies the list &quot;fishtypes&quot; in the two code segments and mention how it is used for the purpose of the program as data from the list is accessed in a loop. They also identify what is being stored in the list, which is the type of fish and the number of a specific fish caught. | 1 | None | . 3 | Managing Complexity | 1 | Requirements met - In the repsonse they explain how the code uses a list of lists to manage complexity. They say that they need this list because it allows for more fish to be added to the data list instead of making new variables every time. | 1 | None | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | 1 | Requirements met - There is a student-devleoped procedure, &quot;clone+movment+range&quot;, with the multiple, five, parameters that are used and they show that they call this procedure. They also show how this procedure contributes to the overall function by stating that that procedure determines wehre the clone of a sprite spawns, the movement, and where it goes, allowing for the program of catching a fish to be more challenging. | 1 | None | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | 1 | Requirements met - They have a student-devleoped algorithm, &quot;clone+movement+range&quot;, that has sequencing, if else statement, and iteration, a for loop, and their response explains this well in enough detail to be recreated. | 1 | None | . 6 | Testing | 0 | Requirements not met - They don&#39;t describe the two calls, they just explain what types of call they are. They dno&#39;t explain the conditions, either, they just say what is tested by the calls. | 0 | None | . Summary/Takeaways: . From these four submissions, something I noticed was how important the written response is. Previously, I thought that you should put most of the effort into the actual program and video. However, upon reviewing this weeks and past submissions, I realize that many people did have correct code but they didn’t get the point because their written response didn’t meet the requirements. When doing my written response, I think it would not only be helpful to check in with the college board criteria, but also for me to reference both the submissions who got the point and those who didn’t, to see what I should and shouldn’t do. .",

Notes . Different code that all completes the same task can have different amounts of times to run | This amount of run time shows varyihg levles of polynomical efficiency | Sometimes requirements that have to be met are very complex, and ideally it would be good to meet all of those requirements perfectly | However, it may be hard or take too long to meet those perfectly, a Heuristic approach is when we sacrifice optimal solutions to improve efficiency and easy of programming, by using solutions that are &quot;good enough&quot; to have a satisfactory outcome | .

Worked at several high tech companies, major three HP, Qualcomm, and Thermo Fisher Scientific (current) | Started at HP Felt very burnt out and took a 6 month break | . | Switched to Qualcomm after the break | Swithced to Thermo Fisher Scientific (current) | . Mission Statements . HP: Create technobolgy that makes life better for everyone, every,where | Qualcomm: Inventing the tech the world loves | Thermo Fisher Scientific: Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer All of these mission statements revolve around the consumers and the products they are interacting with. . | . What does she do? . Senior Director in Marketing and Economics Supervise marketing operations of the company | Commertialize products | Communicate with others | . | . Kris Porter . Engineering Career . Software Engineer - SRE, DevOps, Infrastrucutre | Engineering field that doesn’t write code all day | . Journey . UCLA Electrical Engineering - Master’s and Bachelor’s degree | Failed CS class second quarter at UCLA Retook and got a C | . | Stopped programming for 8 years, then became a programmer | Researched at the center for Embedded Networked Sensors | . Jobs . Shops that fixed mac computers | Data center that dealt with routers | Job at start up in 2010 Email marketing automation Secure networks, database, passwords, etc | . | DevOps | . | NBC Universal Streaming media infrastructure | . | Switched to a startup at Qualcomm DevOps | Working with servers | Data collection | Automation | . | Twitter | . Continous Learning . Constantly learning new things | Computer networking, maching learning, deep learning, data strucutre and algorithsm, system design for interactions, etc | . Q and A . Experience with Agile Methodology . Different companies have different defintions of Agile | Qualcomm focuses on communication | One month intervals | Skillset in agile methodology is highly regarded, can get certification | . Machine learning at Qualcomm . Learn how to use exposed Python libraries | Run epxeriences | Tensorflow | . Data Analysis . Predict patterns in the data | Use data bases and data science | . Most important skill to have in the tech industry (Takeaways) . Do what you like, don’t be afraid to change | Continuous learning, be open to new ways of learning | Don’t be too concerned about the things you read on the news, much is misleading, just focus on yourself and learn the skills you want | Take risks, the only risk is to not try to learn | Adaptive, your journey, especially your career path will have many highs and lows | Listen to the requirements and translate it to how technology will solve/meet those requirements | . How to overcome challenges in the tech indsutry . Going through changes at Qualcomm, be adaptive | Being able to pass tests, tests where you have to make code in a certain time and have it work | . Takeaways . This panel discussed a lot of ideas that I had previously not thought about. Much of it revovled around change. A takeaway I had is how important it is to be able to overcome and utilize change. This society is really competitive and always changing as it is developing very quickly. There will be many ups and downs in your career path, so you need to be adaptive and be able to take risks so you can overcome this change. Something specific I noticed that is important regarding change is continuous learning, where you constantly learn new skills and knowledge on an ongoing basis. . Another takeaway I had is how you should focus on your own learning, goals, and skill set. It’s important to focus on yourself and what is best for you. I really admire how Kathleen Beveridge quit her job and took a break when she was feeling burnt out, because this way you can focus on yourself and refocus your goals and leanring targets. Also, you shouldn’t let the media distract or scare you too much, especially since most of the information is exaggerated or misleading. . Overall, I found this panel really interesting and it had a lot of good ideas. .",

            "content": "Hack #1 - Class Notes . Simulations | Abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real word, able to draw inferences without constraints of the real world | Use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomnom | Remove specific details an simplify aspects, contain bias based on what is included or excluded | Formulation of hypothese un der consideration | Variability and randomess with random number generators | Ex: rolling dice, spinner, molecular models, analyze chmicals/reactions | . Random: import random . random.choice() - returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence | random.choice(mylist) - returns random value from list | random.randint(0,10) - randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 | random.random() - will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. | . Question: Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 . foodPerDay ← 20 . foodLeft ← 160 . daysStarving ← 0 . REPEAT 5 TIMES { . foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay . foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed . IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { . daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 . } . Why is this simulation considered an abstraction? . 1: It uses a conditional to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met. 2: It uses a REPEAT loop to run the same block of code multiple times. 3: It simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. 4: It does not request input from the user or display output to the user. . Answer: #3 - An abstraction redefinesor simplifies something, which is what 3 talks about . Hack #2 - Functions Classwork . import random x = random.randint(1,100) print(x) . 54 . import random def mycloset(): myclothes = [&quot;red shoes&quot;, &quot;green pants&quot;, &quot;tie&quot;, &quot;belt&quot;] x = random.choice(myclothes) ans = input(&quot;Would you like to keep your &quot; + x + &quot;? : (y/n)&quot;) if ans == &quot;n&quot;: myclothes.remove(x) print(myclothes) else: print(myclothes) mycloset() .

Tails Heads Tails Heads Heads . Explanation: Here, I changed the range of the random.randint() function. I also changed it so that if this outcome is 0 or 2 it is heads. Since there are 3 possible outcomes of this function, 0 or 1 or 2, and 2/3 of those options are heads, the coin flip is now unequal. 2/3 chance for heads, and 1/3 chance for tails. .

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it NumPy, random, pandas | Choose a method from the package and import only the method ex: randint is a method of random package | import the package as a more convenient name. import as | import random as rd print(rd.randint(1,10)) from random import randint as ri print(ri(1,10)) import math as m nums = [1, 2, 3, 4] print(m.fsum(nums)) . 7 7 10.0 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | roundes to the smallest integer greater than or equal to x | . floor() | rounds to largest integer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial of x | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . import math as m x = float(input(&quot;Enter a number:&quot;)) y = float(input(&quot;Enter another number:&quot;)) # Rounded up ceil_x = m.ceil(x) print(ceil_x) ceil_y = m.ceil(y) print(ceil_y) # Rounded down floor_x = m.floor(x) print(floor_x) floor_y = m.floor(y) print(floor_y) # LCM of the rounded down print(m.lcm(floor_x,floor_y)) # GCF of the rounded up print(m.gcd(ceil_y,ceil_y)) # Square root print(m.sqrt(ceil_x)) . 6 8 5 7 35 8 2.449489742783178 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . Extra: I also added a random sidelength generator . . Unit 3.15 Random Values . Purpose/Objectives: Teach student how to implement randomness into their code to make their code simulate real life situations. In this lesson students will learn: . How to import random to python | How to use random with a list or number range | How to code randomness in everyday scenarios | . ADD YOUR ADDITIONAL NOTES HERE: . Random values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all numbers occuring | Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result | Random outputs in the word: Coin flip, marbles, dice | We need random values for code: games, statistical sampling, cryptography, etc | . Random values can be used in coding: . import random random_number = random.randint(1,100) print(random_number) . 19 . def randomlist(): list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;blueberry&quot;] element = random.choice(list) print(element) randomlist() . blueberry . Real life example: Dice Roll . import random for i in range(3): roll = random.randint(1,6) print(&quot;Roll &quot; + str(i + 1) + &quot;:&quot; + str(roll)) . Roll 1:2 Roll 2:5 Roll 3:1 . Challenge #1 . Write a function that will a simulate a coinflip and print the output . import random def coinflip(): options = [&quot;Heads&quot;, &quot;Tails&quot;] print(random.choice(options)) coinflip() . Tails . Homework . Given a random decimal number convert it into binary as Extra convert it to hexidecimal as well. . Extra: I did a decimal to octal converter too . import random x = random.randint(1, 255) ## Decimal to Binary numsBin = [] def convertBin(x): x = int(x) while x/2 != 0: rem = x % 2 numsBin.append(rem) x = int(x/2) numsBin.reverse() binary = &quot;&quot; for i in numsBin: binary = binary + str(i) return binary print(str(x) + &quot; to binary: &quot; + convertBin(x)) ## Decimal to Hex numsHex = [] dict = {0:&#39;0&#39;, 1:&#39;1&#39;, 2:&#39;2&#39;, 3:&#39;3&#39;, 4:&#39;4&#39;, 5:&#39;5&#39;, 6:&#39;6&#39;, 7:&#39;7&#39;, 8:&#39;8&#39;, 9:&#39;9&#39;, 10:&#39;A&#39;, 11:&#39;B&#39;, 12:&#39;C&#39;, 13:&#39;D&#39;, 14:&#39;E&#39;, 15:&#39;F&#39;} def convertHex(x): x = int(x) while x/16 != 0: rem = x % 16 numsHex.append(dict[rem]) x = int(x/16) numsHex.reverse() hex = &quot;&quot; for i in numsHex: hex = hex + str(i) return hex print(str(x) + &quot; to hexidecimal: &quot; + str(convertHex(x))) ## Decimal to Octal numsOct = [] def convertOct(x): x = int(x) if x &lt; 8: octal = x return octal else: while x/8 != 0: rem = x % 8 numsOct.append(rem) x = int(x/8) numsOct.reverse() octal = &quot; &quot; for i in numsOct: octal = octal + str(i) return octal print(str(x) + &quot; to octal: &quot; + str(convertOct(x))) . 203 to binary: 11001011 203 to hexidecimal: CB 203 to octal: 313 .",

To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. .

Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . Done with step in range function . sum = 0 counter = 2 for i in range (1, 10, counter): sum = sum + i print(sum) . 25 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . x = int(input(&quot;Enter any positive integer:&quot;)) print(x) def collatz(x): while x != 1: if x % 2 == 0: x = int(x/2) else: x = x * 3 + 1 print(x) collatz(x) . 6 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 .

Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute?

            "content": "Results: . . Q13 Test cases for allPositive in a list . Answer A doesn’t encounter a positive number, therefore it reutnrs the intended answer. The correct answer is C, because the procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. . Q30 Benefit of using a list when rounding . For Answer A, the algorithm used to round a numeric value to the nearest integer will be the same regardless of whether the value is stored in a list. The correct answer is B, because using a list as a data abstraction can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain. It is easier to apply the same algorithm to every element in a list than to apply the same algorithm to many separate variables. . Q36 Store even numbers in evenList . Answer B is incorrect, because it generates the list [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21] since i is initialized at 1. Answer C is correct, becaue for the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3.

It gave me an idea of what type of stuff they are working with and how advanced it is, and even gave me some ideas for future projects I could do. Here, me and claire are looking at a CSA group project that connected songs and moods. You could rate what mood you thought a song was, generate a song based on your mood, etc. . Things to improve on . Better time management | Usage of API | Learn all areas | . Ideas for trimester two NATM project: . Something besides a game, more practical | Catalog with different songs, recipes, etc | Dictionary with words and definitions and thesaurus with synonyms and antonyms of words | .",

A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors. | A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose. | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. | A computer network is a type of computing system. | A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver. | Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. | The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. | Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second. | . 4.1 Daily Video 2 . Essential Knowledge: . The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols. | Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an Internet connected device. | A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. | The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet. | Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance. | The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. | The Internet was designed to be scalable. | Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. | Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets. | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly. | Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all. | IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet | The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files. | HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web. | The World Wide Web uses the Internet. | .",

            "content": "console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, Aliya!&quot;); . Hello, Aliya! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, Aliya!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, Aliya! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, Aliya! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Types of variables in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;APCSP Group&quot;); // String logItType(2022); // Number logItType([&quot;Aliya&quot;, &quot;Ananya&quot;, &quot;Claire&quot;, &quot;Sreeja&quot;]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Types of variables in JavaScript string ; APCSP Group number ; 2022 object ; [ &#39;Aliya&#39;, &#39;Ananya&#39;, &#39;Claire&#39;, &#39;Sreeja&#39; ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... . Building an Array, &quot;var students&quot; is an array of many persons | Building a Classroom, this show forEach iteration through an array and .push adding to an array. These are key concepts in all programming languages. | . // define a student Array of Person(s) var students = [ new Person(&quot;Aliya&quot;, &quot;aliyatang&quot;, 2025), new Person(&quot;Ananya&quot;, &quot;Ananyag2617&quot;, 2025), new Person(&quot;Claire&quot;, &quot;ClaireChen3&quot;, 2024), new Person(&quot;Sreeja&quot;, &quot;sreejagangapuram&quot;, 2024) ]; // define a classroom and build Classroom objects and json function Classroom(teacher, students){ // 1 teacher, many student // start Classroom with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); this.teacher = teacher; this.classroom = [teacher]; // add each Student to Classroom this.students = students; this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.classroom.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Classroom this.json = []; this.classroom.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci classroom from formerly defined teacher and students compsci = new Classroom(teacher, students); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci classroom logItType(compsci.classroom); // constructed classroom object logItType(compsci.classroom[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . object ; [ Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Aliya&#39;, ghID: &#39;aliyatang&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Ananya&#39;, ghID: &#39;Ananyag2617&#39;, classOf: 2025, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Claire&#39;, ghID: &#39;ClaireChen3&#39;, classOf: 2024, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Sreeja&#39;, ghID: &#39;sreejagangapuram&#39;, classOf: 2024, role: &#39;Student&#39; } ] string ; Mr M string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} object ; { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } . IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid white;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

If you want to go far, go together.” -African Proverb | . | . 1.1 Daily Video 2 - Collaboration Computing innovations are imrpoved through collaborations. Computing innovations are developed by groups of people. . Example: Collaborate in class: - Pair programming: one programmer writes code and one reviews each line, checking for any mistakes or giving any suggestions - Think-Pair-Share: student thinks through problem alone, then pairs up with a partner to share ideas, then shares results with the whole class . - Leave comments in code: - communicate to partners and yourself - acknowledge code segments and media used from other sources - differentiate you and your partners work - clarify the functionality of your code Online Tools for collaboration: - repl.it: multiplayer - GitHub: collaboration and repostiory - Shared document or folder - Note: Check with your teacher about your coding platform . Takeaways: Consulting with other people is important, as you can get multiple perspectives and what others think about your program (you may miss your own faults and mistakes) There are many online tools you can find by searching, see what works best for you and your partner. :) . Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests? . No, not stricly. Though I first joined my group because I was former classmates of some of the members, I think this allows us to work well together and communicate. | . Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives? . Yes, my group has diverse backgrounds and perspectives. These differences allow us combine multiple different ideas and help when others make mistakes. | . Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom? . I think my group has many different skill sets that prove useful when collaborating. Even if we don’t have a certain skill set or run into a problem, we are able to figure it out together. | .",

Easy mode: Multiple choice questions | Hard mode: Text input / More mchoice options / Harder character to guess | . Basic Things To Implement: . Home Button | Next Button | Back Button (?) | Start and End Screen | . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of my program is to be a quiz with different modes asking about disney princesses. | . Data Abstraction . I implemented this through the variables that counts the number of times someone submits an answer. This is used during the text input in the hard section to determine when to show the correct answer. | . Managing Complexity . I explained my the complex parts of my quiz through problems I ran into during the process, and listing things that helped. | . Procedural Abstraction . I think my quiz incorporates many complex functions such as multiple choice and text input that is based on the user input, counting the number of tries, etc. | . Algorithm Implementation . I think I could implement different loops for iteration. | . Testing . I went through much trial and error, and tested all the functions of my quiz to make sure everything was working the way I wanted it to. | . Problems During the Process . Code.org uses JavaScript in block form, which I&#39;m not too familiar with. When trying to implement different things with the blocks like if/else statements, defining variables, etc, I had to go through a lot of trial and error to see what would work. . | When changing to the text mode to edit, it was very confusing and took some time getting used to. Overall, I found it helpful to mostly stick with the blocks, and occasionally switch to text mode and compare the blocks and the actual code to get familiar with it. . | A specific problem I ran into while coding my App Lab was the text input part where a user inputs an answer to the question. I needed to check if the answer inputted is correct. I tried out several different blocks and block combinations until I found something that worked. I also searched online for JavaScript syntax to compare to the text version of my code. . | Another specific problem was the if/else statement that was used to check if the user&#39;s inputted answer is correct (ex: if the text input = &quot;answer&quot;, then... else: then...). I wanted to add two different answers that were very similar in the &#39;if&#39; part. I recalled that you are able to use &quot;or&quot; in python, and searched online to find that || operator is JavaScipt&#39;s &quot;or&quot;. However, when I usedthe || operator it messed up my code and showed errors. In the end, I was able figure it out and implement it by using &quot;elif&quot;. . | .

            "content": "Lists and dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. . In the code below, information about two different pets are being added into the dictionary using the append method. . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values, in this case # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to pets InfoDb.append({ &quot;Species&quot;: &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Apollo&quot;, &quot;Nickname&quot;: &quot;Bingus&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;2 years&quot;, &quot;Owner&quot;: &quot;Aliya&quot;, &quot;Fur_Color&quot;: [&quot;Orange&quot;], &quot;Eye_Color&quot;: &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Fav_Toy&quot;: [&quot;Shoe&quot;, &quot;Laser Pointer&quot;, &quot;Plastic Wrap&quot;,&quot;Box&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;Species&quot;: &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Luca&quot;, &quot;Nickname&quot;: &quot;Mart&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;: &quot;2 years&quot;, &quot;Owner&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Fur_Color&quot;: [&quot;Orange&quot;,&quot;White&quot;], &quot;Eye_Color&quot;: &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Fav_Toy&quot;: [&quot;Mouse Plush&quot;,&quot;Box&quot;,&quot;String&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

For Loop . In the code below, we take the stored data about the pets and output/print it in the notebook. First we prepare a function to format the data, then a function to iterate through the InfoDb list, and lastly activate the function with the call to the defined function. . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;Name&quot;], &quot;the&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Species&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Owner:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Owner&quot;]) # t is tab print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Nickname:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Nickname&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Age:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Age&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;,&quot;Traits: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot; + &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Fur_Color&quot;]), &quot;fur with&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Eye_Color&quot;], &quot;eyes&quot;) #putting multiple values in one section (traits) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Favorite Toy(s): &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) #the end makes sure it doesn&#39;t enter to a new line print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Fav_Toy&quot;])) print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration . In coding, there are usually many wasy to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustratng using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . While Loop . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() . In the code below, the while loop outputs the information about the pets. The program doesn&#39;t end as long as the variable number (i) is less than the length of the InfoDb list. . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Recursion . The code below prints information about the pets with recursion by calling itself repeatedly. The progam ends once the i value exceeds the length of the InfoDb length, just like the while loop. . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Apollo the Cat Owner: Aliya Nickname: Bingus Age: 2 years Traits: Orange fur with Green eyes Favorite Toy(s): Shoe, Laser Pointer, Plastic Wrap, Box Luca the Cat Owner: Alice Nickname: Mart Age: 2 years Traits: Orange + White fur with Yellow eyes Favorite Toy(s): Mouse Plush, Box, String .

            "title": "Alumni Panel Takeaways",
            "content": "One of my biggest takeaways from today’s Alumni Panel is how useful taking APCSA and APCSP can prove to be. Even though the alumni all took APCSP and/or APCSA, many of them didn’t specifically major in computer science. Some majored in cognitive science, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, and more, but they all used some aspects of computer science in their major. Furthermore, knowledge of computer science can open so many opportunities that wouldn’t have been possible without it, for example the alumni who did internships despite not being in a computer science major. Specifically, I took notice of Mabel who got an internship at Northrop Grumman where she analyzed flight data which was possible just because she took APCSA. This really shows how APCSP and APCSA is useful even just as basic skill and knowledge, and knowing the foundations can be really helpful as the world becomes more technologically driven. . Another takeaway was the fact that you should actually try and learn instead of cutting corners and just focusing on grades. I feel like so many students nowadays are grade oriented and don’t actually focus on actually learning the material and taking it to heart, and not just in this CSP class. As many of the alumni said, this could be due to several different reasons such as competitiveness among students, pressure from parents, and more. They made several good points that you shouldn’t let others discourage you and that you should focus on your own learning path. This helped open my eyes and reinforce the fact that I should take this class seriously and not give up, especially considering how important it is as stated in my first takeaway. Similarly to Nitya, I have been interested in computer programming and STEM since a very young age, so what the alumni mentioned helped remind me that I’m taking this class because I am interested in expanding my knowledge of computer science, not just for a grade. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

A specific example, the find_by_uid(uid) function and the check_credentials(uid, password) function. These two are methods to identify user to credentials uid and password, and they are used several times throughout the code, for example find_by_uid(uid) function is used in the update and delete functions to make sure that the desired user to be updated or deleted actually exists. So, instead of having to write out the code block to go through the database to check if a uid exists, you can just call the function. The check_credentials(uid, password) function is also used in the create and update functions, and it verifies if the password inputted matches the uid. This is just a validation system to make sure that people can't randomly modify or delete other people's data. Same thing for the find_by_uid(uid), instead of having to write out the code block to go through the database to check if the password matches the uid, you can just call the function. Both of these functions are procedures that validate something based on the chaging parameters, which are uid and password. It organizes the code and makes it easier for the user to use or understand it. \n",

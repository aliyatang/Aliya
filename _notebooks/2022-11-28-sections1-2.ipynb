    "# Variables and Assignment Python\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- Represent a value with a variable: strings, lists, booleans, numbers\n",
    "- Deetermine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "### Defining Variables\n",
    "- Variable name \"one word\"\n",
    "- Variabels can be numbers, string, lists, or boolean\n",
    "- Use equal (=) sign to define\n",
    "- Strings have quotations \"\" around it\n",
    "- Functions and conditiosn with variables, including print()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nathematical Expressions\n",
    "- Mathmatical expresions can be preformed on the variable that is numerical value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions on Lists\n",
    "- Functions can be preformed on lists, such as append()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "- Defined using curly brackets and equal sign\n",
    "- Keys and values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interchanging Variables\n",
    "- INterchange vriables using temporary variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floats\n",
    "- Define variabvles using float dta types isntead of just integer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Even Function\n",
    "- Define function with def and colon\n",
    "- Parenthesis () after function name\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variables and Assigment in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number\n",

    "## Data Abstraction\n",
    "- Provides a separation between the batraqct properties of a data type and the concrete details of its represenation\n",
    "- Manage complexiity in programs by giving a collectioin of data a name withut referencing specific elements of the representation\n",
    "- Makes it easier to implement, develop, and maintain code\n",
    "- Us eof listws allows for mutipel related values to be treated as a single vaaaue\n",
    "- On AP exams index values for lists start from 1, not 0 like in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "### Using simple lists and wokring with vairables\n",
    "- Lists can organize, maintain and develop related data\n",
    "- e.g. A shopping cart with multiple items, instead of having each item in the cart be its own variable, all the data can be under one variable. If the shopping cart changed, you can edit the list instead of deleting the entire variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking lists into more lists\n",
    "- List of data can be split even more\n",
    "- e.g. Separate a list of dta into 2 new lists\n",
    "- Organize dta recieved from APi's an othe rresources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organising different items in the lists\n",
    "- Indidivudal elements can be called, sparated,and organised using for loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting and joining lists and data inside them\n",
    "- split() - splits a string itmo a list, where you can speciy the separtator, default separator is any whitespace\n",
    "- join() - takes all items in iterable and joins them into one string, which must be specified as the separator\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Abstraction in JavaScript\n",

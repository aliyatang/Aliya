<h1 id="takeaways">
<a class="anchor" href="#takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Takeaways</h1>
<p>This panel discussed a lot of ideas that I had previously not thought about. Much of it revovled around change. A takeaway I had is how important it is to be able to overcome and utilize change. This society is really competitive and always changing as it is developing very quickly. There will be many ups and downs in your career path, so you need to be adaptive and be able to take risks so you can overcome this change. Something specific I noticed that is important regarding change is continuous learning, where you constantly learn new skills and knowledge on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>Another takeaway I had is how you should focus on your own learning, goals, and skill set. It’s important to focus on yourself and what is best for you. I really admire how Kathleen Beveridge quit her job and took a break when she was feeling burnt out, because this way you can focus on yourself and refocus your goals and leanring targets. Also, you shouldn’t let the media distract or scare you too much, especially since most of the information is exaggerated or misleading.</p>

<p>Overall, I found this panel really interesting and it had a lot of good ideas.</p>

  <li>Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an Internet connected device.</li>
  <li>A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.</li>
  <li>The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet.</li>
  <li>Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance.</li>
  <li>The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands.</li>
  <li>The Internet was designed to be scalable.</li>
  <li>Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream.</li>
  <li>Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets.</li>
  <li>Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly.</li>
  <li>Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all.</li>
  <li>IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet</li>
  <li>The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files.</li>

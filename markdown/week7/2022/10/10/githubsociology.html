<ul>
  <li>“git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git)</li>
  <li>.git directory contains a local database that keeps track of local changes</li>
  <li>“git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database</li>
  <li>.gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree</li>
  <li>“git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). Often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors</li>
  <li>To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable.</li>
  <li>Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository.</li>
  <li>“git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Create Pull Request</p>
<ul>
  <li>We haven’t considered making pull requests to track development, but we plan to read the attached blog post on how to ultilize them.</li>

<p>Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban?</p>

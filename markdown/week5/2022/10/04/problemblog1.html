</ul><p>First, I ran into a problem when I wanted to pull something from github to my local server. I stopped the local docker processes by using ‘sudo docker-compose kill’ and then pulled.</p>

<p>However, after force restarting the web application and dock container, it wouldn’t let me run docker compose with ‘sudo docker-compose up -d’</p>

<p>After reading the error message, I found that I could either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete the volume</li>
  <li>Change the none type to another type</li>
</ul>

<p>First, I tried to delete the volume. However, it said that the volume was in use and I couldn’t delete it.</p>

<p>I couldn’t figure out why it was doing this, as the volume wasn’t in use.</p>

<p>I tried to change the type, as it said that a volume with the same name uses a type that is different than none - “bind”. So next, I changed the type to a different type, “bind”.</p>

<p>This worked. It let me run ‘sudo docker-compose up -d’ and my webpage was recreated.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>I could also finally verify that my webpage is running with the curl command, “curl http://localhost:8086</td>
      <td>html2text”, as it wasn’t working before either.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>I was also able to make a change and see the change made in the brower.</p>

<p>Lastly, I was able to use a Domain Name Server(DNS) provider to map my own public IP address to a domain, called “aliyaflask.tk” or “www.aliyaflask.tk”.</p>

<p>Essential Knowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The purpose of computing innovation sis to solve porblems or to pursue interests through creative expression</li>
  <li>An understanding of the purpose of computing innovation provides developers with an imporved ability to develop that computing innovation</li>
</ul>

<p>Computing Innovations</p>

<p>Categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applications (games, social media, business, productivity)</li>
  <li>Physical devices (computers, smart phones/tablets, smart “things”, wearables)</li>
  <li>Systems (e-commerce, cloud services, email)</li>
</ul>

<p>Investigate the purpose of these computing innovations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social media apps: allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activies</li>
  <li>E-commerce: allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home</li>
  <li>Digital assistant device: allows users to control their devices hands free, safer while driving or more convinient when multitasking</li>
</ul>

<p>Essential Knowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in avariety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</li>
  <li>An event is associated wiht an action and supplies input data to a program</li>
  <li>Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution</li>
  <li>Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program</li>
  <li>In event driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control</li>
  <li>Input can come from a user or other programs</li>
  <li>Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</li>
  <li>Program output is usually based on a program’s input or prior state (ex: internal values)</li>
</ul>

<p>Identifying inputs to programs
Computer programs accept input in a variety of diff forms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tactile (touch)</li>
  <li>audio</li>
  <li>visual</li>
  <li>
    <p>text (including numberical values)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Smart phones, tablets, and laptops can accept input as well</li>
</ul>

<p>How do programs receive input?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most programs are written in an event driven environment, events are triggered by some action which usually sends input ot the program</li>
  <li>Events users can trigger include mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes(force touch)</li>
  <li>Physical button clicks</li>
  <li>Keyboard entries</li>
  <li>Audio trigger (key word or phrase)</li>
</ul>

<p>What does input accomplish in a program?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Input usually affects the output, which includes visual, audio, tactile, text</li>
</ul>

<p>How does a program know what to do upon an event?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Action may be initated by the user or another program/device</li>
  <li>The program “jumps” to the code segment according to the event</li>
  <li>Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered)</li>
  <li>Program code not necessarily executed “in order’, they are as they are called according to the events triggered</li>
</ul>

<p>Essential Knowledge</p>
<ul>
  <li>A program is a collection of program statemetns that preforms a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often reffered to as software</li>
  <li>A code segment is a collection of program statemtns that is part of a program</li>
  <li>A program needs to work for a variety of input sand situations</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a program?</p>
<ul>
  <li>A collection of statements</li>
  <li>A statement is a single command</li>
  <li>A group of statements is called code segment</li>
  <li>Code segments are exectued according to the rules of the programming language</li>
</ul>

<p>Takeaways</p>
<ul>
  <li>The behavior of a program is how a program cuntions during execution and is foten describe by how a user interacts with it</li>
  <li>A program can be described broadly by what it does, or more in detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtns accomplish this function</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project?
We are thinking of doing a game similar to Wordle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose?
I think a Wordle project would have a lot of aspects that would challenge us and let us learn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks?
Yes, this project is something we are all interested in an it is pretty complex</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed?
Yes, it is a fun game that everyone can play</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission?
Yes, it is complex and meets the requirements</p>
  </li>
</ol>

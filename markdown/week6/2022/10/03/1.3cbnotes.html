On some questions, I wasn’t too sure and just used process of elimination to answer. It’s helpful to look through results and see the explanation of correct answers.</p>

<p>Essential Knowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature.</li>
  <li>There are multiple development processes. Theses phases are commonly used when developing a program:
    <ul>
      <li>investigating and reflecting</li>
      <li>designing</li>
      <li>prototyping</li>
      <li>testing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.</li>
  <li>A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.</li>
  <li>The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.</li>
  <li>Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.</li>
  <li>Some ways to preform investigation:
    <ul>
      <li>collect data through surveys</li>
      <li>user tsting</li>
      <li>interviews</li>
      <li>direct observation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Program requirement s describe how a program fucntions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide</li>
  <li>A program’s specificaiton defines the requirements for the program</li>
  <li>In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplisha  given program specification</li>
  <li>The desing phase a a program may include:
    <ul>
      <li>brainstorming</li>
      <li>planning and storyboarding</li>
      <li>organizing the program into moduels and fucntional components</li>
      <li>creation of diagrams that represent the laouts of the user interface</li>
      <li>development of a testing strategy for the program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Essential Knowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were devloped collaboratively or by another source</li>
  <li>Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. the acknowledgement should incldue the orgiin or original author’s name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essential Knowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed</li>
  <li>Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and od not affect how a program runs</li>
  <li>Programmers should document a program throughout it sdevelopment</li>
  <li>Program documentation helps in devloping and maintaining correct programs when working indiviudally or in collaborative programming environments</li>
  <li>Not all programming environments support commennts, so other methods of documentation may be required</li>
</ul>

## 1.2 Daily Video 1
Essential Knowledge:
- The purpose of computing innovation sis to solve porblems or to pursue interests through creative expression
- An understanding of the purpose of computing innovation provides developers with an imporved ability to develop that computing innovation

Computing Innovations

Categories:
- Applications (games, social media, business, productivity)
- Physical devices (computers, smart phones/tablets, smart "things", wearables)
- Systems (e-commerce, cloud services, email)

Investigate the purpose of these computing innovations:
- Social media apps: allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activies
- E-commerce: allows users to save time and money by being able to shop from home
- Digital assistant device: allows users to control their devices hands free, safer while driving or more convinient when multitasking


## 1.2 Daily Video 2
Essential Knowledge:
- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in avariety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text
- An event is associated wiht an action and supplies input data to a program
- Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution
- Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program
- In event driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control
- Input can come from a user or other programs
- Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text
- Program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state (ex: internal values)

Identifying inputs to programs
Computer programs accept input in a variety of diff forms:
- tactile (touch)
- audio
- visual
- text (including numberical values)

- Smart phones, tablets, and laptops can accept input as well

How do programs receive input?
- Most programs are written in an event driven environment, events are triggered by some action which usually sends input ot the program
- Events users can trigger include mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes(force touch)
- Physical button clicks
- Keyboard entries
- Audio trigger (key word or phrase)

What does input accomplish in a program?
- Input usually affects the output, which includes visual, audio, tactile, text

How does a program know what to do upon an event?
- Action may be initated by the user or another program/device
- The program "jumps" to the code segment according to the event
- Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered)
- Program code not necessarily executed "in order', they are as they are called according to the events triggered

## 1.2 Daily Video 3
Essential Knowledge
- A program is a collection of program statemetns that preforms a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often reffered to as software
- A code segment is a collection of program statemtns that is part of a program
- A program needs to work for a variety of input sand situations

What is a program? 
- A collection of statements
- A statement is a single command
- A group of statements is called code segment
- Code segments are exectued according to the rules of the programming language

Takeaways
- The behavior of a program is how a program cuntions during execution and is foten describe by how a user interacts with it
- A program can be described broadly by what it does, or more in detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtns accomplish this function

## Program function and Purpose Questions
1. Do we have final project ideas for a PBL Web Project?
We are thinking of doing a game similar to Wordle

2. Are we considering a project that is best for our educational purpose?
I think a Wordle project would have a lot of aspects that would challenge us and let us learn

3. Is the project going to hold team members interest for 8 weeks?
Yes, this project is something we are all interested in an it is pretty complex

4. Does the project have potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks? ie Customer or Sponsor needed?
Yes, it is a fun game that everyone can play

5. Does the project have potential to be used for Create Performance Task submission?
Yes, it is complex and meets the requirements

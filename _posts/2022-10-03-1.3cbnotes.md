On some questions, I wasn't too sure and just used process of elimination to answer. It's helpful to look through results and see the explanation of correct answers. 

## 1.3 Daily Video 1
Essential Knowledge:
- A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature.
- There are multiple development processes. Theses phases are commonly used when developing a program:
    - investigating and reflecting
    - designing
    - prototyping
    - testing
- A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
- A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
- The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.
- Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.
- Some ways to preform investigation:
    - collect data through surveys
    - user tsting
    - interviews
    - direct observation
- Program requirement s describe how a program fucntions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide
- A program's specificaiton defines the requirements for the program
- In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplisha  given program specification
- The desing phase a a program may include:
    - brainstorming
    - planning and storyboarding
    - organizing the program into moduels and fucntional components
    - creation of diagrams that represent the laouts of the user interface
    - development of a testing strategy for the program

## 1.3 Daily Video 2
Essential Knowledge:
- It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were devloped collaboratively or by another source
- Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. the acknowledgement should incldue the orgiin or original author's name. 

## 1.3 Daily Video 3
Essential Knowledge:
- Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed 
- Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and od not affect how a program runs
- Programmers should document a program throughout it sdevelopment
- Program documentation helps in devloping and maintaining correct programs when working indiviudally or in collaborative programming environments
- Not all programming environments support commennts, so other methods of documentation may be required

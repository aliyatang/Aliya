Watching videos is very helpful. I took the Internet Quiz without watching any videos or looking at outside sources and didn't get the questions.

Essential Knowledge:
- A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.
- A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.
- A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own runtime errors.
- An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values.

Essential Knowledge:
- Effective ways to find and correct erros: test cases, hand tracing, visualizations, debuggers, and adding extra output statements

-  In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes. Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs.
- Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes (minimum and maximum) of input data.
- Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing.

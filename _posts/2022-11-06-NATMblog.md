Besides presenting at the Night of the Museum, I was able to see other projects. I saw many different types of art, such as studio art and ceramics.

I think it was espeically cool to see the AP CSA students' projects. It gave me an idea of what type of stuff they are working with and how advanced it is, and even gave me some ideas for future projects I could do.

## Ideas for trimester two NATM project:
- Something besides a game
- Catalog with different songs, recipes, etc
- Dictionary with words and definitions and thesaurus with synonyms and antonyms of words

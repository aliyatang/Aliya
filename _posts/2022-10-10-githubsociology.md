## Vocab
- “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git)
- .git directory contains a local database that keeps track of local changes
- “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database
- .gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree
- “git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). Often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors
- To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable.
- Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository.
- “git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch.

## Questions

What is the main repository for your project?
- The main repository for our project is the Group_Flask repository, and it is under Claire Chen’s name

Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? 
- No, we haven't created a .gitignore yet. However, our group is planning to make one because it can help make the process of commiting our final project more streamlined.

Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base?
- No, we don’t have a requirements.txt file, but we think it’s a good idea to create one so we can stay organized. 

Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? Creating Issues
- Yes, we have established Issues. We also made a space on our scrum board to add issues throughout our development process.

Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Create Pull Request
- We haven’t considered making pull requests to track development, but we plan to read the attached blog post on how to ultilize them.

Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests?
- No, we haven’t considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests.

Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban?
- Yes, our group is managing issues on Project Board/Scrum Board. We have a fully organized scrum board on github that is shared by all members of our group.

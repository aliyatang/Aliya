# Takeaways
This panel discussed a lot of ideas that I had previously not thought about. Much of it revovled around change. This society is really competitive and always changing as it is developing very quickly. There will be many ups and downs in your career path, so you need to be adaptive and be able to take risks so you can overcome this change.Something important I noticed is continuous learning, where you constantly learn new skills and knowledge on an ongoing basis. Overall, I found this panel really interesting and it had a lot of good ideas.

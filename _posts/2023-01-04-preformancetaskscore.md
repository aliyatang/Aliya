        <td>Program Purpose and Function</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>
            Requirements met - The program has the input of the triangle side lengths and output of the information about the triangle, including classifcation of the triangle, degrees of each angle, trigonemetric values, etc. They also mention the program purpose and functinality, which is to help with information about triangles based on inputted side lengths. 
        </td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>The described purpose, to provide information about a triange, is actually the functionality of the program. They only described the functionality and not the purpose. This is something to take note of in my own project, as I feel that purpose and function may be hard to differentiate between if not careful.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Data Abstraction</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>
            Requirements met - The program meets the requirements of two code segments. For example, one is how they implement and identify sideIndex, which stores the data of the types of triangle. Second, they use sideIndex in the program to fulfill the program and identify and output what triangle it is based on the input.

        <td>Managing Complexity</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>
            This program does not manage complexity well. In the written response, the code uses a list that has all the classifcations under one variable(sideIndex), when ideally this is not needed because they could just use strings instead of lists. So, their written response explanation does not show how they manage complexity either.

            Requirements met - The student-developed procedure(ratioCalculate) has three parameters that effects how they are ordered for the ratio. This procedure is also being called. They also describe what the procedure does, which is to calcualte the ratio fo the triangle sidelengths to store as values in sideRatio.

            Requirements met - The program has an input of the users clicking to result in the outputs, for example the choice to remove tiles on the grid and control the simulation(pause, restart, reset, etc). The program function and purpose are both identified, with the function as an interactive simulation and its purpose as serving entertainment for the user.

They also describe the functionality of the procedure, which is to take inputs identifying numbers for two lists and replace have the first replace the second while still being able to recall the previous points.

### Note: 
Submission 1 is an example of a lacking Create Preformance Task with multiple missing requirements, while Submission 2 is an example of a good one. I could look back on this for reference on mine as it could be very helpful in seeing what should be done and what shouldn't.
